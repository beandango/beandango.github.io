            <h2>About Dango's Behavior...</h2> 
            <p>
                "The strangest thing has occured recently. I had just finished transcriping the below interaction. 
                <blockquote>
                    <b>Handler:</b> So, Dango. I hope you are finding yourself at home here. Would you be willing to share anything about yourself? We really do want the best for you. I come from a place of wanting to understand and help you. <br><br>
                    <b>Dango:</b> ... <br><br>
                    <b>Handler:</b> You won't speak? <br><br>
                    <b>Dango:</b> ... <br><br> 
                    [Dango looks down for a moment, and holds out her hands. Somehow, there is a little grey rat made out of what looks like playdoh in her hands.] <br><br>
                    <b>Handler:</b> Hold on! Where did you get that? Who let you bring this with you? 
                    <br><br>
                    [I took the rat from her hands and reached to put it in my pocket. As soon as I looked back up... there was a large pile of them, Dango sitting gleefully in the middle of them.] <br><br>
                    <b>Handler:</b> Unbelievable... 
                    <br><br>[It seems as though Dango has some power of material creation. I wonder how far it goes...]
                    <br>
                </blockquote>
                
                "Just as I closed the door behind me, I glanced back to look at her through the window. She had vanished!
                <br><br>
                Not only is this extremely concerning for the safety and integrity of our facility, but extremely confusing as well? Where could she have gone? How would it even be physically possible for something like this to happen? <br><br>
                Just as I went to sound our alarms, I had an even stranger feeling come over me. I felt her begin to slip away, like I had woken up from a dream. Was I dreaming? <br><br>
                My belief in her existence steered me back to the door. I opened it cautiously, and there she was. Still sitting in her pile of rats that had suddenly raced back into my memories. She looked confused, and I was. 
                <br><br>
                When I left the room again, I decided to not look back. Maybe the key to understanding Dango is... moving forward, and never looking back."
