We have reports of Mr. █████'s erratic behavior over the past several weeks, but our check-ins with the subject have always come up unfruitful. He always seemed like an... <a href="thecraftsman.html">odd, but otherwise normal guy.</a> <br><br>Perhaps this is the profound failure of our facility for not catching these things sooner, and not looking beyond the inconspicuous exterior. <br><br>
                
                Nevertheless, we do have clues that maybe one day, can point us in the right direction. But for now... what exactly happened that day is anyone's guess." <br><br>-Handler
